# Soda (they/them) ðŸŒ¸

### $ whoami
I'm __Soda__(0x50d4) and I'm a highschool student, who dabbles in cybersec their free time. I am planning on posting blog posts like writeups and my personal findings. 

I aim to provide entertaining but educational content for everyone for free. 

My interests are constantly changing and I'm chasing things that I find cool:)

Currently doing:
- Programming (learning Rust ðŸ¦€)
- Reverse engineering
- CTFs
